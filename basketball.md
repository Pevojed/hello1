# Data Scraping and Cleaning

I need someone who can either scrape or manually pull data and enter it into a spreadsheet. 
This is an example of the page I am looking to pull data from: 
https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba-odds-2009-10/  
Data should be delievered in .csv format. 
Attached is an example file of what I would like the data to look like when taken from the 
page I linked to. I can explain the rules if you need.  
Attachment [Example.xlsx](/basketball/Example.xlsx)  
Screenshoot   
![](/basketball/Example.jpg)  
Output data:  
Attachment [basketball_data.csv](/basketball/basketball_data.csv)  
Screenshoot   
![](/basketball/basketball_data.jpg)
